This prototype is supposed to mimic the relationship between an AI Chatbot and the program.

The prototype is just a set of 4 windows, 3 of which can only be accessed when their button is clicked. The intention is that each button represents a completed string of keywords the AI Chatbot will hand to the program after receiving input from the user. 

It will be very limiting to the user and time-consuming for the developers to hardcode every possible way a user command the chatbot.
